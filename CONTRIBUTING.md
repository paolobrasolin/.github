## Foreword

Financial support is of course welcome.

You can find links relevant to all of the points above in the sidebar of the project repo GitHub page.

## How to contribute

Before investing lots of time on something, ask for feedback on your idea first!

You can do that through the GitHub issue creation.
It will offer you a choice:

* file a bug report;
* suggest a new feature;
* request support;
* report a security vulnerability.

Follow the instructions and if after getting feedback you want to put in the effort, you're good to go.
The workflow is pretty much the canonical one.

1. Fork the repo and clone your fork.
2. Setup the project for development.
3. Make your changes and commit them to a new branch.
4. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
5. Wait for review and merge.

If you're a novice you can learn the details of that from some excellent resources:

- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
- [About pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)

Thanks again for any effort you will put into the project!
