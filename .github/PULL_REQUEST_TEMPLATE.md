Please follow these basic guidelines _as best as you can_ when submitting a pull request.

- **Title** of the PR should be **self-explanatory**.
- **Description** of the PR should **summarize** your changes and clarify their **purpose** (bugfix, feature, ...) and **impact** (positive, breaking, ...).
- **Changes** introduced by the PR should be as **small** and as **specific** as possible.
- **Commits** included in the PR should be **atomic** and have **meaningful** messages.

You can help further by taking the actions among the following which apply.

- Refer to all relevant issues in the description.
- Be explicit about the feedback you need. (E.g. is this a WIP you need help with?)
- Respect existing code. (E.g. don't refactor carelessly, avoid running tests or ignore configured linters.)
- Write tests and documentation when needed. (E.g. when implementing a new feature.)

**MOST IMPORTANTLY** don't let missing any of the points above discourage you! Perfection is useless compared to collaboration.

All pull requests are reviewed by @paolobrasolin and feedback will be provided.
